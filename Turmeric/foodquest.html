<p> It gives immense pleasure to me to present this page to you. Aren't we all a foodie at heart? Can we all agree to the point that we all like to explore different cuisines? or that whenever we would get time we would like to book tickets on the fly to a favorite destination just to get a glimpse of our favorite recipe at a particular restaurant or drive in or dhaba? Sometimes whenver I got time I feel like becoming this wanderer just to explorer new places, diving into the popular regional cuisines and just take a break from our normal lives. What a treat it is to be able to see different parts of world. But its not possible always to do this hence I am bringing in this page so that we all can share experiences of our food quest which makes us go out and try different dishes from around the world.
